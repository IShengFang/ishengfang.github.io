## Description
I am a graduate student of The Master's Degree Program in Robotics in National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan. My advisor is [Prof. Yong-Sheng Chen](https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/members/detail/yschen).
Before that, I was a graduate student of Department of Computer Science in National Cheng Chi University, Taiwan. My advisor is [Prof. Yan-Tsung Peng ](http://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~ytpeng/).I was a research assistants of Enriched Vision Applications Lab, National Chiao Tung University from September 2018 to September 2019, led by [Prof.Wei-Chen (Walon) Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/#publications).

My research interests are in the area of gerative model, model uncertainty, style transfer, computer vision and deep learning. I also interest in their creativity applicationm, likes East Asian Ideograph font design and style transfer. I believe AI is new electricity. I also believe math can light up the black box of deep learning.

I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematical Science at National Chengchi University in January, 2018

My personal interests are Typography, Film Photography (check out my instagram [@ishengfang](https://www.instagram.com/ishengfang/)), Cycling and Baseball.
