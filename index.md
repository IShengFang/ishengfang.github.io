I am a Research Assistant in CITI at Academia Sinica, working with [Dr. Jun-Cheng Chen](https://www.citi.sinica.edu.tw/pages/pullpull/index_en.html). Before that, I received my Master degree in Robotics at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University (the merger of National Chiao Tung University and National Yang Ming University) in January, 2023. My advisors are  [Prof. Yong-Sheng Chen](https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/members/detail/yschen) and  [Prof. Wei-Chen (Walon) Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/). I was a graduate student of Department of Computer Science in National Cheng Chi University, Taiwan, working with [Prof. Yan-Tsung Peng ](http://www.cs.nccu.edu.tw/~ytpeng/). I was a research assistants of Enriched Vision Applications Lab, National Chiao Tung University from September 2018 to September 2019, working with [Prof. Wei-Chen (Walon) Chiu](https://walonchiu.github.io/). I received my Bachelor degree in Mathematical Science at National Chengchi University in January, 2018.

My research interests are in the area of generative model, self/wakly-supervised learning, depth estimation, style transfer, computer vision, and deep learning. I am also interested in their creative application, such as East Asian Ideograph font design, deepfake for education. I believe AI is a leverage, augmenting human ability not only in monotonous tasks but also in content creation. 

My personal interests are Typography, Film Photography (check out my instagram [@ishengfang](https://www.instagram.com/ishengfang/)), Baseball, Strength and Conditioning Training.
